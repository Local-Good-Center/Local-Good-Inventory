The Spring 2022 team will focus on documenting all the requirements for the project through discussing with the Local Good Center representative and consulting the EPICS advisors. Then the team will create a basic UI/UX design of the website for the front end, and a database design for the backend. The team will finally implements aspects of the design to construct a basic prototype of the website by the end of the semester.",
